# What is CrowdSauce?
CrowdSauce, is a social networking application that allows end-users to share and discuss recipes. In many other popular social networking platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram, many end-users use the functionality to post pictures of their food. CrowdSauce seeks to build upon the core idea that users like sharing their food by providing an application that allows users to post pictures of the food they are eating along with a recipe describing how to make it. We see many use cases for this platform notably, college students who are living on a budget have access to all of their friends food creations and how they made them, users sharing satirical images of food that didnâ€™t quite work out, or users sharing their favorite home-recipes with all their friends. Succinctly put, CrowdSauce is a social networking application providing users a platform for sharing and finding recipes from their friends.
